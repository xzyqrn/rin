# Rin — Telegram AI Bot

A personal Telegram bot powered by [Trinity](https://openrouter.ai/arcee-ai/trinity-large-preview) via OpenRouter. Rin remembers things about you across conversations, runs on a Linux VPS, and can manage the server, browse the web, schedule tasks, monitor uptime, and more.

---

## Features

- **Persistent memory** — conversation history and extracted user facts are stored in SQLite and injected into every prompt, so Rin remembers you across restarts
- **Per-user isolation** — every Telegram user has their own private memory, notes, reminders, and storage
- **Multi-user support** — any number of users can chat simultaneously
- **Tool-calling** — Rin uses OpenAI-compatible function calling to act, not just talk
- **Graceful fallback** — if the model doesn't support tool calling, Rin falls back to plain chat seamlessly
- **Rate limiting** — configurable per-hour message cap for non-admin users
- **API usage tracking** — every LLM call logs token counts to SQLite

## Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js v18 or later
- A Telegram bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
- An OpenRouter API key from [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
- Your Telegram user ID — message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) to get it

### 2. Clone and install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Rin
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your values (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) below).

### 4. Run

```bash
npm start
```

Expected output:

```
[db] SQLite initialized.
[bot] Rin is online.
[poller] Reminder + health-check pollers started.
[cron] 0 job(s) loaded.
[webhook] Server listening on port 3000
```

---

## Running on a VPS (Production)

Run Rin under [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) so it survives crashes and reboots.

```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start src/index.js --name rin
pm2 save
pm2 startup    # follow the printed command to enable autostart
```

Common PM2 commands:

```bash
pm2 logs rin        # live log tail
pm2 restart rin     # restart
pm2 stop rin        # stop
pm2 status          # overview of all processes
```

## Usage Examples

### Conversation & memory

```
You:  My name is Jay and I work as a backend engineer.
Rin:  Nice to meet you, Jay. Backend — what stack are you on?

# restart the bot

You:  Hey, do you remember me?
Rin:  You're Jay, a backend engineer. What's up?
```

### Reminders

```
You:  Remind me to push the deployment in 30 minutes.
Rin:  Done. Reminder #4 set for 3:45 PM: "push the deployment"

# 30 minutes later, Rin messages you:
Rin:  Reminder: push the deployment
```

### Notes & storage

```
You:  Save a note called "Deploy checklist" — run migrations, restart workers, clear cache
Rin:  Note "Deploy checklist" saved.

You:  What's in my deploy checklist?
Rin:  [Deploy checklist] run migrations, restart workers, clear cache
```

### Web browsing

```
You:  Summarise the Node.js 22 release notes
Rin:  [fetches nodejs.org] Here's a summary: ...
```

### VPS control (admins)

```
You:  How's the server doing?
Rin:  [runs system_health] Memory: 1.4 GB / 4.0 GB used (35%)
      Load: 0.12 / 0.15 / 0.11 — Uptime: 12d 4h 21m — Disk: 18G / 50G (36%)

You:  Is nginx running?
Rin:  [runs systemctl status nginx] Yes, active and running. No errors.

You:  Tail the app log
Rin:  [runs tail -n 30 /var/log/app.log] Here's what I see: ...
```

For direct execution without LLM interpretation:

```
/shell journalctl -n 50 --no-pager
/shell df -h && free -m
/shell ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10
/status
```

### Cron jobs (admins)

```
You:  Send me a good morning message every day at 8am UTC
Rin:  [calls create_cron] Job "good-morning" created — runs at "0 8 * * *"

You:  Check if my API is up every 5 minutes and alert me if it goes down
Rin:  [calls add_health_check] Health check "api" added for https://myapi.com/health
```

### Webhooks (admins)

```
You:  Create a webhook called "github-push"
Rin:  Webhook "github-push" created.
      URL: https://yourserver.com/webhook/a3f9bc...
      POST JSON to that URL and it will appear here.
```

Configure it in GitHub → Settings → Webhooks, and you'll receive push notifications directly in Telegram.

## Background Services

Three background processes run continuously after `npm start`:

| Service | Interval | What it does |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Reminder poller | 30 s | Sends any due reminders via Telegram |
| Health check poller | 60 s | Checks registered URLs; alerts on state change |
| Cron scheduler | per job | Runs jobs on their configured cron expressions |

---

## Database

The SQLite database lives at `data/rin.db` and is created automatically.

### Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `memory` | Per-user conversation history (last 20 turns used as context) |
| `user_facts` | Durable facts extracted from conversations (name, job, etc.) |
| `reminders` | Scheduled reminder messages |
| `notes` | User notes keyed by title |
| `storage` | Arbitrary key-value pairs per user |
| `cron_jobs` | Recurring scheduled jobs |
| `health_checks` | URLs being monitored for uptime |
| `api_metrics` | LLM call log with token counts |
| `rate_limits` | Per-user per-hour message counts |
| `webhooks` | Registered webhook endpoints and tokens |

### Inspecting the database

```bash
sqlite3 data/rin.db

sqlite> SELECT * FROM user_facts WHERE user_id = 123456789;
sqlite> SELECT content, timestamp FROM memory WHERE user_id = 123456789 ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10;
sqlite> SELECT * FROM reminders ORDER BY fire_at;
sqlite> SELECT model, SUM(tokens_in + tokens_out) as total FROM api_metrics GROUP BY model;
```

## Security Notes

- All admin tools — shell, files, cron, monitoring, webhooks — are gated by `ADMIN_USER_ID`. Non-matching users cannot trigger them.
- Shell commands are checked against a configurable denylist (`SHELL_DENYLIST`) before execution, and all invocations are logged.
- Run the bot under a dedicated low-privilege OS user, never as root.
- Shell commands time out after 30 seconds; output is capped at 3 500 characters.
- `browse_url` blocks requests to private/loopback addresses (SSRF protection).
- Webhook tokens are 48-character hex secrets generated with `crypto.randomBytes`.
- The webhook server runs on plain HTTP; a reverse proxy with TLS (nginx, caddy) is required in production.
- File uploads are capped at `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` (default 50 MB) per file and `MAX_USER_QUOTA_MB` (default 500 MB) per user.
- Tool errors are sanitized to strip absolute paths and stack traces before being shown to the LLM.
- The `data/` directory and `.env` are git-ignored.
