## 2024-05-18 - Improve accessibility of inline HTML templates
**Learning:** Even simple success/callback screens (like OAuth redirects) rendered as inline strings in API routes need full HTML structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html lang="en">`, `<meta name="viewport">`). Without them, they break on mobile and are inaccessible to screen readers. Relying on inline `onmouseover`/`onmouseout` for hover states prevents keyboard users from seeing focus states. Hardcoded colors fail to respect system dark mode preferences.
**Action:** When creating or modifying inline HTML responses, always include standard boilerplate, use `<style>` blocks with CSS variables and `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` for theme support, and define `:focus-visible` pseudo-classes to ensure keyboard accessibility. Ensure semantic elements like `<main>` are used.
