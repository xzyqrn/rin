## 2024-10-24 - Add native command menu to Telegram bot
**Learning:** In a chat-based UI that lacks standard HTML forms or buttons, users have poor discoverability for available commands. Without an explicit list of commands native to the client, users are forced to memorize them.
**Action:** Always register a bot's commands with the Telegram platform via `setMyCommands` to populate the native Menu button and enable command auto-complete.
